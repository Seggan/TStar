## Overview

TStar is a high-performance, cross-platform image processing suite built with C++17 and Qt6, designed
specifically for the demands of astrophotography. It integrates a wide range of professional-grade signal
processing algorithms alongside modern AI-based restoration tools, enabling astrophotographers to produce
scientifically accurate, publication-quality images from raw sensor data.

The application targets both casual astrophotographers and advanced users who require precise numerical
control over every stage of their image processing workflow, from raw frame calibration through stacking,
stretching, color calibration, and final export.

## Overview

TStar is a powerful, C++17/Qt6-based image processing platform explicitly designed for astrophotography. It combines high-performance signal processing algorithms with modern AI-based restoration tools to help astrophotographers produce scientific-grade images from their raw data.

## Key Features

*   **Native FITS Support**: Full compatibility with 8, 16, 32-bit integer and floating-point FITS files.
*   **MDI Workspace**: Flexible Multi-Document Interface allowing simultaneous editing of multiple images.
*   **Project Management**: Sidebar with Console logging and FITS Header inspection.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Fully supported on Windows, macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), with optimized performance.

## Tools & Functionalities

### 1. Stretching & Linear to Non-Linear
Tools to transform raw linear data into viewable images.
*   **Auto Stretch (Statistical)**: Automatically stretches the image based on statistical analysis. Ideal for quick previews.
*   **Generalized Hyperbolic Stretch (GHS)**: State-of-the-art stretching with independent control over shadows, midtones, and highlights.
*   **Histogram Transformation**: Classic levels adjustment with real-time logarithmic preview.
*   **Curves Transformation**: Precision spline-based contrast / color adjustment.
*   **ArcSinh Stretch**: Color-preserving stretch that boosts saturation while stretching.
*   **Star Stretch**: Specialized tool for stretching stars independently (often used with star masks).

### 2. Color Calibration & Correction
*   **Photometric Color Calibration (PCC)**: Solves the image plate and calibrates colors based on Gaia/APASS photometric star catalogs.
*   **PCC Distribution**: Visualizes the color distribution of stars after calibration.
*   **Catalog Background Extraction (CBE)**: Advanced background extraction using catalog reference images (DSS2, etc.) for highly accurate gradient models.
*   **Auto Background Extraction (ABE)**: Models and removes light pollution gradients using polynomial or RBF interpolation.
*   **Background Neutralization**: Removes color casts by aligning background channels.
*   **Temperature / Tint**: Adjust manual white balance by shifting color tones and green/magenta tints.
*   **Selective Color Correction**: Precise adjustment of CMY/RGB/L/S/C within specific hue ranges.
*   **SCNR (Subtractive Chromatic Noise Reduction)**: Removes generic Green/Magenta color noise.
*   **Saturation**: Adjust color intensity with luminance preservation options.

### 3. AI & Restoration
*   **Cosmic Clarity**: Deep-learning based noise reduction and sharpening.
*   **GraXpert Integration**: Seamless bridge to run GraXpert for AI gradient removal.
*   **StarNet++ Integration**: automated star removal to create starless images for separate processing.
*   **Aberration Remover (RAR)**: Corrects chromatic aberration and star halos.

### 4. Channel Management
*   **Extract / Combine Channels**: Split RGB into Mono or combine Mono into RGB.
*   **Debayer**: Convert RAW Bayer pattern images to full color.
*   **Extract / Recombine Luminance**: Independent extraction and blending of the luminance channel.
*   **Remove Pedestal**: Automatically detects and subtracts the minimum pixel value (black floor).
*   **Star Recomposition**: Advanced tool to merge starless and stars images back together with blending modes.
*   **Perfect Palette Picker**: Mapping narrowband data (SHO, HOO, etc.) to artistic color palettes with real-time preview.
*   **Continuum Subtraction**: Enhances narrowband details by subtracting broadband continuum/star light.
*   **Align Channels**: Align multiple open images (narrowband/RGB) using star registration.
*   **NB -> RGB Stars**: Specialized tool to blend narrowband star channels with RGB star data.
*   **Narrowband Normalization**: Balances narrowband channels for compositing with highlight recovery.
*   **Multiscale Decomposition**: Decomposes images into wavelet layers for scale-specific editing.

### 5. Masking
*   **Mask Generation**: Create masks based on Luminance, Chrominance, Star Detection, or Specific Color Hues.
*   **Manual Masking**: Draw masks using polygons or shapes.
*   **Mask Tools**: Invert, Blur, and Overlay visibility controls.

### 6. Image Pipeline (Preprocessing)
*   **Image Calibration**: Calibrate raw light frames using master Bias, Dark, and Flat frames.
*   **Image Registration**: Star-based alignment with sub-pixel accuracy (translation, rotation, scale).
*   **Image Stacking**: Noise reduction using Average, Median, Kappa-Sigma, or Winsorized Sigma stacking.

### 7. Utilities & Effects
*   **Plate Solving**: Native astrometric solver to determine image coordinates (WCS metadata).
*   **PixelMath**: Powerful expression engine for arithmetic operations between images.
*   **Star Analysis**: Measure FWHM, eccentricity, and other star profile metrics.
*   **Image Annotator**: Add object labels using catalog data.
*   **CLAHE**: Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization for local contrast enhancement.
*   **Wavescale HDR**: Multiscale High Dynamic Range compression.
*   **Aberration Inspector**: 3x3 grid display for evaluating optical quality across the field.
*   **Correction Brush**: Interactive artifact removal using Content-Aware AI or standard median sampling.
*   **Rotate & Crop**: Precision cropping with aspect ratio constraints and batch processing support.
*   **RAW to FITS Converter**: Batch convert camera RAW files (Canon, Nikon, Sony, etc.) to FITS.
*   **FITS Header Editor**: View and modify FITS metadata keywords.
*   **AstroSpike**: Generates artificial diffraction spikes for aesthetic effect.

### 8. Scripting & Automation
*   **TStar Scripts**: Built-in processing workflows for common tasks.
*   **Script Runner**: Write and run custom TStar scripts (.tss) for complex multi-step automation.
